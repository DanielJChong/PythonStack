Run these commands in the order instructed. Your assignment submission should be a .txt file that includes a short explanation of what you were able to learn about each command by doing a brief (1-2 min) web search for each term. If it is relevant, include the output of your command and your understanding of what it means. It is important to always read your terminal output and try to understand it.

Run the following commands:

1. pip list 

- Shows all programs installed into my c-drive.



2. deactivate (This will deactivate your virtual environment) 

- Deactivates our environment. Sends me back to my computer (C-drive) 



3. pip3 list (How is the result different from when you ran pip list with the virtualenv activated? Hint, you should not have as many things listed when the virtualenv is deactivated. If your results are the same, go back and figure out what went wrong.) 

- It seems like pip list shows what is installed.  When in the virtualEnv, it only shows what is installed in that environment.  So only a few things in my flaskEnv.



4. source myEnvironments/py3Env/bin/activate (Adjust the path as needed to re-activate the virtualenv; for windows call myEnvironments/py3Env/Scripts/activate) 

- This activates that specific environment.  I have currently called my flaskEnv.



5. pip install Django==2.2.4 (What information do you see returned in terminal after this command?) - 

- (djangoEnv) C:\Users\danie\Documents\codingdojo\python_stack\my_environments>pip install Django==2.2.4
